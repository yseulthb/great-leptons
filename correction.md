As a part of our everyday life, science should be open, accessible and understandable to and by everyone. Invoked in decision and policy making or involved in sanitary and health advice, science has to be trustworthy and thus be robust and thought thoroughly. The first objective of science, both fundamental and applied science, should be to serve our societies, by extending our knowledge of various phenomena and offering new perspectives. To be improved, we believe that science should be shared within scientific communities and with the general public. We also believe that science should be independent of any competition, may it be competition among scientists or through funding attribution. Making good science takes time, which is required if we want to understand what is being done and studied, how data is collected and analysed, how methods can be improved, or whether findings are not due to chance. Inspired by Skinner’s advice in his book Walden II, we want to experiment with new ways of doing science.

By open we refer to research practices that enable to gain scientific knowledge in a transparent and accessible way.

By slow we refer to an approach where the rate of work is not dictated by productivist imperatives. We want to take time to understand what we do, how we do it, and why we do it.

By sustainable we refer to a scientific method which does not jeopardise its own preservation nor the preservation of its ecosystem. We want a science for and based on equity. We aim to struggle for diversity, prosociality, and against dominations (sexism, racism, social classes, specism, etc…). We believe that a robust science can foster and be fostered by a sustainable society.

We are an independent laboratory. Some of us also work in academic institutions and some of our projects involve collaborations with classical academic research entities. However, the Walden III Slowpen Science Laboratory is not affiliated to any university or to any other public/private research organism. Currently, we do not possess any physical lab space but our official geographical location is in Villeurbanne (suburban Lyon) in France.

toolbox: Here you will find some useful tools we use, and some tools we find interesting in order to improve our scientific practices. We attach importance to free and open tools/content in order to increase transparency, sharing, reproducibility, and replicability of scientific data.

ppl: He also has his own youtube channel, focusing on the popularisation of psychology.
